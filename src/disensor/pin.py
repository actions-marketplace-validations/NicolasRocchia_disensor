"""Pin the gate Action to a commit SHA: `disensor pin`.

A tag can be moved, so the README lists pinning by SHA as a deployment
requirement. Until this command existed, that resolution was homework for
whoever deployed, and it has two traps that both bit this same repository:
`git rev-parse` on an annotated tag returns the TAG object instead of the
commit it wraps, and a SHA copied or typed by hand can simply be wrong (a
hand-extended SHA reached a commit here and only the test suite stopped it).
The command asks the canonical repository and rewrites the workflow lines in
place, so neither trap is reachable.
