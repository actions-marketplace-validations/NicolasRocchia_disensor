"""Packaged adversarial briefs: `disensor prompt`.

The schema asks for `prompt_hash`, the hash of the adversarial brief that was
used, and until now the tool asked for that hash without ever handing out a
brief: whoever installed it had to invent one and hash it. That left the hardest
part of the method, getting a second model to attack in earnest, entirely on the
user, and made the run impossible for anyone else to reproduce.

Shipping the brief closes both holes. The text travels inside the package, so
`disensor prompt --gate diff --hash` gives a value anybody can recompute from
the same version. Editing the brief is expected and fine: the hash changes and
the declaration then records that a different brief was used, which is exactly
what the field is for.
